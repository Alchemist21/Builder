Your task is to create three functions on the smart contract that will allow a single owner to register new voters and allow the registered voters to vote.\n\n## Constructor Owner\n\nFirst create a constructor that will register the `owner` as the person who deploys the smart contract. Only the 'owner' will be allowed to `register` new voters. \n\n## Register Voters \n\nCreate a function called `register` that will take an `address` and register that voter.\n\n## Vote \n\nCreate a function `vote` that will capture a registered voter's vote. \n\nThis function will take in a `bool` that indicates whether or not the voter supports the vote. You can store the vote any way you wish for now. \n\nEnsure that if a non-registered voter calls this function, it will `revert`. ",
