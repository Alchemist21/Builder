It has six functions that are used to handle the supply and transfers of the tokens. \n\nThe original proposal for ERC20 can be [found here](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20). \n\nAs far as implementation, the [Consensys EIP20 Token](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol) is used for this challenge.",

This is allowed by default in the [ERC20 token standard](?tab=details&scroll=ERC20%20Standard). \n\nWe want to make it so anyone can withdraw any ERC20 token balance from the Treasure Chest. That way, treasure hunters can come along and claim their prize! \n\n### Withdraw function\n\nIn order to accomplish our task, implement the `withdraw` function on the `TreasureChest` contract. \n\nThis function will take in an array of ERC20 Token Contract addresses as it's only argument. It will make a call to each ERC20 Contract to transfer the balance of the TreasureChest to the address calling the function.",
