  "task": "## Countdown to Zero!\n\nYour task is to create a Vyper Smart Contract that can store ether and countdown from a given number to zero. Once the countdown reaches zero, the ether should be given to the last person who called the contract. Then the contract should self-destruct.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to create two public functions.\n\n### Constructor\n\nFirst, create a public constructor which is called when the contract is deployed. \n\nThis function should be able to take ether payments, or in other words, it should be `payable`.\n\nThis function will need to take in a `uint256` count, which is the initial value to start the countdown at. You'll need to store this value so it can be decremented on every `tick`.\n\nTo see an example of a constructor, take a look at [this example](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.3/vyper-by-example.html#simple-open-auction).\n\n### Tick Function\n\nCreate a public function called `tick` that will take the count and decrement it. \n\nIf the count should ever reach zero, this function should destroy the contract and send all funds to the person who called the function.\n\nA certain [built-in function](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.3/built-in-functions.html#built-in-functions) will be helpful for this particular functionality.",
