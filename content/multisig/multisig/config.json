  "intro": "## What is a Multi-Signature Wallet?\n\nA Mulit-Signature(Mulit-Sig) wallet is similar to any other account on the Ethereum network as it can receive or send funds. However, unlike a personal account owned by a sole party, a Multi-Sig wallet is owned by multiple parties. As such, it is common with Mulit-Sig wallets to implement a restriction on the transfer of funds from the wallet to another address until the transaction is confirmed by a pre-determined number of the owners.\n\n![Multi-Sig Contract](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfzlfy8h3/image/upload/v1540883906/flowchart.png \"A Mulit-Signature Wallet Contract\")\n\nIn this learning module, we will build the smart contract for a basic implementation of a multi-signature wallet. At the end of the module, you will be able to download your code into a working application. Let's get started!",
