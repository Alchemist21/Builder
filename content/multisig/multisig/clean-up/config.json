Invoke `executeTransaction` within `confirmTransaction`\n\nOnce the multi-sig has been confirmed by enough owners to meet the requirement, invoke the execution. This saves the owner from having to manually invoke the execution.\n\n2. Change `addTransaction` function visibility from `public` to `internal`\n\nAn `internal` function can only be called from within a Solidity contract. Since we built a `submitTransaction` function to handle the creation and confirmation of a `Transaction` we no longer have the need for `addTransaction` to be called externally.",
