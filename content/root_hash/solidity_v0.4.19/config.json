  "intro": "## Root Hash\n\nHi there! The goal of this code challenge is to find a root hash from a series of hashes derived by splitting a potentially large bytes array into 32 byte chunks. \n\n### Challenge Skills\n\nBy completing this challenge you demonstrate knowledge of manipulating byte arrays including splitting, hashing and concatenation. \n\nThis can be used for things like validating Merkle Proofs, so it's a useful thing to learn!",
