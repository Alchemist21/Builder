  "task": "## Spread the Token\n\nIt's time to spread the token and write out a `transfer` function. This will allow addresses to send tokens to other addresses. \n\nNow the person who deploys the contract can share tokens with all their friends! \n\n### Transfer Function\n\nCreate a public function called `transfer`. This [function](?tab=details&scroll=Function%20Signature) should take in two arguments:\n\n1. A `uint256` amount of tokens to transfer\n2. An `address` for who to transfer to \n\nThe person transferring the tokens is the person calling the function (remember it's `msg.sender`). \n\nYou'll need to [update](?tab=details&scroll=Update%20a%20Mapping) the balances mapping to transfer the tokens from the `msg.sender` to the `address` passed into the `transfer` function signature.\n\n> It may be helpful to declare a [local variable](?tab=details&scroll=Local%20Variables) inside the function. In which case the declaration is similar to how we declared state variables, except inside the function body.",
  "details": "## Function Signature\n\nIn Vyper a public function signature with multiple arguments looks something like this:\n\n```\n@public\ndef multiple(something: uint256, person: address): \n    # your code\n```\n\n## Update a Mapping\n\nRemember, to update a mapping you can use the `key` and then set the `value` like so:\n\n```\nmyMapping[key] = value\n```\n\n## Local Variables\n\nLocal variables can be created inside of the function body like so:\n\n```\n@public\ndef myFunction(something: uint256): \n    something_else: uint256\n    something_else = something + 5\n```",
