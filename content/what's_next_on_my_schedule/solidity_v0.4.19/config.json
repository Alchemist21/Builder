  "intro": "## What's next on my Schedule?\n\nThis is a Solidity Smart Contract challenge where you will be given a smart contract with a list of meetings and you'll need to find the nearest one that hasn't already passed. \n\n### Challenge Skills\n\nBy completing this challenge you show that you can iterate through a Solidity array of structs and sort uint timestamps in Solidity based on its proximity to the current time, which is an available global to your smart contract. \n",
