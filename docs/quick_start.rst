Quick Start

For an easy Setup, we commend you use the |Builder CLI|:

.. |Builder CLI| raw:: html

   <a href="https://github.com/ChainShot/Builder-CLI" target="_blank">Builder CLI</a>


Simply install :code:`chainshot-builder` globally using :code:`npm`, then run
it from your new content repository!

::

  npm install -g chainshot-builder
  mkdir myContentRepository
  cd myContentRepository
  chainshot-builder

And that's it!

The Builder CLI will spin up the application for you. Any changes
you make within the UI will be written to your file system.

Simply commit any changes up to Github (:ref:`create_git_repo`) and
then link ChainShot to your Github account (:ref:`linking_github`)!

If you'd like to develop on the Builder itself, check out :ref:`builder_development`.
