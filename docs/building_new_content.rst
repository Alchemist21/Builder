Build New Content
#################

Here are the steps to start from scratch and build your own content.

Setting Up
==========

First, if you haven't already, follow the instructions on :ref:`setting_up`.

Start Editing
=============

Once you have Builder up and running you'll be able to create your own content.

You'll be given the choice between starting from any of the stage container types
(see :ref:`container_types`).

Once you're inside the editor you'll be able to configure your stage container
and start adding stages. Any changes made within the editor will automatically
save to your file system.

Pushing Up to Github
====================

Now that you have your


Connecting your Github Repository
=================================

Once you have your Content repository up on Github you'll be able to link to it
from ChainShot to hook up to automatic deployments. ChainShot will transform your
content repository into interactive tutorials. Any changes to your content repository
will automatically be reflected on the ChainShot site.

Connect to Github
-----------------

To set this up, navigate to your profile on ChainShot:

Github Webhook
--------------

Once you have hooked up your Content repository on ChainShot a webhook will be
created on your Github repository. This webhook will automatically notify ChainShot
when changes are made to your Github repository so that the new Content can be deployed.

You can view the status of the latest deployments on your deployments page.

Manual Deployment
-----------------

If your deployments ever fail for some reason you can always kick off a manual deployment:

For any help or assistance on why your content has failed deployment, reach out to
ChainShot administrators on Slack and we'll get you set up :)
