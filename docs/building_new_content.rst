TODO: add these instructions, reference them from the readme

To understand more about what's going on underneath the hood, or to help
develop and contribute to the Builder check out the `:ref:builder_structure` section.

Your own Content Repository
===========================

Upon startup, the Builder will automatically create a new folder on the same level
as your Builder repository.
This repository is called Content by default. To configure it, see :ref:`server_configuration`.
